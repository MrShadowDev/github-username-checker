# about
Simple program to find avaiable github usernames.

It uses Wonderwords module to generate usernames and check avaiability. Some usernames could not be avaiable bc they already banned. Otherwise program doesnt have any wrong misinterpretations.

Install requirements and run the program. 

Must know a bit about Python to setup or just use ChatGPT if you can't figure the modules to install.
